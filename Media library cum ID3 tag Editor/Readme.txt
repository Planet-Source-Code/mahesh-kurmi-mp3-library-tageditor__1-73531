ID3 Class:(written  by Mathexpert)
This class allows analyzing and editing of ID3v1 tags, older and newer ID3v2 tags, AND older and newer Lyrics3 tags. I also included a program to manage your MP3s that took me nearly an entire day to make as an example of use of this class. From the list view, you can play a file by double clicking the item or by focusing on the list view and pressing enter. You can also customize the columns in the list view by repositioning them. From the MP3 ID panel, you can view the meta information and/or edit it. The basic view consists of the title, artist, album, genre, track number, year, comments, and lyrics. The more advanced view consists of original artist, original album, copyright, and more. In this view, you can even scroll through the text fields using the middle wheel of your mouse (if available), provided that the list view is not focused. Another feature included is the automatic retrieval of song data from the iTunes store and Microsoft for particular MP3 files. The application will automatically install the vbzlib.dll file required to decompress GZip-compressed iTunes store data if it doesn't detect the DLL file. Thanks to GDI+, you can also add and/or edit album art in MP3 files, and the application is also capable of updating the album art using the automatic retrieval of song data.(You can check it for sample songs in windows)

Mp3 Library:(base from Mortinez mmplayerx)
1. You can add folder to library by
   1. clicking mnuAdd library
   2. Add Folder command button
   3. Ole Drag Drop on list view

2. The tracks added are stored in database file  stored in "App.path + \Library\music.mdb" Dont delete it

3. This code is just for testing my  edia library to be used in Full featured Mp3 player(See screen shot) which is soon to be      completed, so dont expet comments/documentation/formatting etc.,  Just enjoy features.

4. Please click on new Library to completely erase old library data files nad to make your fresh library

5. library supports playcount feature

Mp3 player:
 
I started working on mp3 player 3 years before, but i left it one and half year before because I was engaged in my professional life.But from last month i am working on it.
It supports
1. DFX
2. Skins
3. Visualisation (realistic- smoother than winamp)
4. Media library
5. Dedicated Tag editor
6. Almost no Vb control(other than picture box)
7. Almost all owner drawn controls
8. Supports system Drag drop, File association and many more

I am planning to submit this code to PSC as soon as i complete this but i want all the member to support me by notifying me the bugs and extra features to be implemented and more importantly Suggestions for better performance.
I have included screenshot for my Mp3player.

TRYING KEEP VB ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
